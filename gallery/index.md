# VisLies 2019 Gallery

October 22, 2019

We had another fun year at VisLies.
We were given a bigger room this year, which was good since we had a lot of
attendance.
Once we got through the locked doors we were treated with some good bad vis.


## The Sum is more than its Parts

[Ken Moreland] kicked things off with an illustrative example of a VisLie using a figure [from an article][Kirtland Article] that was published in [his local paper][Albuquerque Journal] the previous weekend.
The article is a report on the positive effects of the local US Air Force Base on the local economy.

The information is, as far as we know, correct.
But look more closely at the pie chart.
Something is odd.
The blue slice is labeled "Overall Impact" and the purple slice is labeled "Local Impact."
Wait a minute.
Wouldn't "Local Impact" be a part of "Overall Impact?"
Yes, it would.
The whole metaphor for a pie chart is broken.

The blue region should, be the whole of the pie (by definition).
The purple region should be a subset of the purple region.
To make matters worse, the mistake is recursive.
The orange wedge, "Local Job Creation," is actually a subset of the purple section.

The dumbest part of all this is that the VisLie is working against the point that the article is trying to make.
The point of the article is that the Air Force Base has a positive monetary effect on the local economy.
Over half the spending goes to the local economy, but this pie chart makes it look like about a third of the spending is local.
